# Fangarde Backend (Public Version)

## Introduction
This repository contains all of the code for the backend of Fangarde's flagship product. The company is no longer operating and the other founders and I have agreed to allow this code to be shared.

## Preface
There are a few things to keep in mind when looking through this codebase.

- This code is meant to be run in conjunction with [Fangarde Frontend](https://github.com/JHau21/fangarde_frontend).
- For a variety of reasons, all of the environment variables and API configurations have been removed. If you want to be able to boot this up and use it for yourself, you'll need to fill in the missing variables. That will include setting up a database, creating accounts with several third parties, and more...
- Although a launch date was set and the application was/is hosted, it was never used for a "real" event. As such, a variety of changes need to be made before this is in a fully workable state.
- This code is no longer maintained and maintenance stopped in November of 2023.
- The .env.example file is meant to serve as a reference for the environment variable configuration. It is **NOT** a secure and optimal storage solution for environment variables.
- This application is no longer serviced by any of the third-party applications mentioned throughout the app.
